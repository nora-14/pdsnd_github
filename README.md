### Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
I used Python to explore bikeshare systems data for Washington, Chicago, New York City and generate descriptive statistics (ex: the most frequent times of travel). Users are able to input which city, month(s), and days they would like to see descriptive statistics for and they are also able to review the raw data.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
